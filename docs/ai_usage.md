I used ChatGPT (model: GPT-5 Thinking) to:
- Clarify several Rosalind problems (INI2–INI6, DNA, RNA, PROT, GC).
- Troubleshoot Colab/Jupyter quirks (argv `-f`, stdin vs files).
- Step-by-step guidance for pushing to GitHub and creating a tag/release.

What I did myself:
- Ran and validated code in Colab, fixed paths, confirmed outputs match samples.
- Organized repository structure and wrote README.
- Created the final tagged release for submission.

Academic honesty:
- I reviewed and understood all code before submitting.
